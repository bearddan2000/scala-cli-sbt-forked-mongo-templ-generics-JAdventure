# scala-cli-sbt-forked-mongo-templ-generics-JAdventure

## Description
A POC for REST web service using mongodb.
Creates a user with credentials.

So modification were made to the JSON
files so as to make them mongo compliant.
`db/init/*.json`. There is a feature in mongodb
to auto load JSON files, but to create the
entities we elected to use a built-in import
function. As a result of the import option, we
put each entity in its own collection.

The web service is RESTful so we follow the
basic Controller->Service->Repository->Model
pattern. Using generics we can reduce the code
needed by Service and Repository layers.
